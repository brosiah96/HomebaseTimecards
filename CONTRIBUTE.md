# Contributing to HomebaseTimecards

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Suggesting new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the project repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.
3. Ensure your code adheres to the existing style to maintain the project's consistency.
4. Update the `README.md` with details of changes, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
5. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
6. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.

## Reporting Bugs
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
